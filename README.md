one more thing I forgot to mention about point 2, in every pages there is 3 sections such as header, hero, boxer and footer and I split it accordingly. When I delivered your home page as a demo. You approved it and there does not make any sense to split each row because I add scss class according to each section. 
So now, what I am going to do.
-changing responsive css into scss,
-implementing hero section as you mentioned in point 1.
-removing completely @/assets/main.scss/pages.scss/_global.scss.
I will write it into hero components.-using import statements.
